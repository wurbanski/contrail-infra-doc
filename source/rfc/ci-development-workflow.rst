CI development workflow
=======================

This document describes the rules that control the development of source code responsible for the testing and build of OpenContrail.

Commit message style guide
--------------------------

|  The commit summary/title line should bo no longer than 50 characters and contain precise information about which repo elements has been changed, to the extent possible.
|  There should be a blank line after the summary.
|  The description text after the blank line should be wrapped at 72 characters at most.
|  The description should explain the rationale behind the change introduced in this commit (i.e. why do we need this change).

Approval workflow for CI projects hosted on Gerrit
--------------------------------------------------

Each CI project has a corresponding user group that contains core reviewers:

- contrail-project-config-core
- contrail-zuul-jobs-core

Each change to those projects should go through a two-step review process, both 
steps have to be performed by reviewers other than the author of the change:

#. The core reviewers group of the project should be added to the review by the author of the change.
#. First core reviewer that accepts the change should place a ``Code-Review +2``
   vote.
#. Second core reviewer that accepts the change should place an ``Approved +1``
   vote that will result in a merge (if the CI tests pass).

The author of the change (regardless if he's in the core reviewers group), can place
a ``Code-Review -2`` vote under his review to prevent others from reviewing it. This
vote should come with a comment explaining the reason behind it.

Approval workflow for CI projects hosted on GitHub
--------------------------------------------------

Pull requests for repositories developed on GitHub should follow this general procedure:

#. Pull Requests should be created from a single-purpose branch created in a personal fork of the repo (not applicable in case of private repos)
#. Pull Requests should be merged by their author after acquiring at least one "Approve" review
#. Pull Requests should be merged using the "create merge commit" strategy
#. the author should request review from the "codilime-contractors-devops" team

Below are specific rules for certain repositories:

Juniper/contrail-infra
**********************

This repo contains Puppet code used to configure the Contrail CI services. Development follows a
special two-stage path that first . The procedure is described below:

#. make sure that you perform a syntax check of your changes: https://github.com/Juniper/contrail-infra/blob/development/doc/source/contributing.rst#syntax-checks-and-linting
#. create and merge a PR to the ``development`` branch first (use the general procedure)
#. to push the changes further to the production branch, create an intermediate commit on the "staging" branch (origin is the J/c-i repo):

   #. ``git checkout production``
   #. ``git checkout -B staging``
   #. ``git merge origin/development``
   #. ``git push origin staging``
#. create a pull request from Juniper/contrail-infra:staging to Juniper/contrail-infra:production
#. merge it using the general procedure
#. after your PR gets merged, push the changes to the production Puppet server (ci-puppetmaster.opencontrail.org)

Juniper/zuul-jobs
**********************

This is a patched fork of the upstream Zuul job/role library. Custom patches to this repo
should be submitted as regular Pull Requests, following the general procedure. Special
situations like updating code by rebasing onto upstream branches should be carried out
after consulting with the rest of the infra team.

Juniper/zuul
**********************

This is a patched fork of the Zuul source repository. Zuul updates are performed by rebasing the patches onto
upstream branch tips. Custom patches to this repo should be submitted as regular
Pull Requests, following the general procedure. Special situations like updating
code by rebasing onto upstream branches should be handled after consulting with
the rest of the infra team.

Emergency procedures - Gerrit
-----------------------------

In emergency situations, when the change is required to fix an error affecting
majority of the CI jobs or daily build jobs, the author can merge the change on
his own by placing both `CR+2` and `A+1` votes under his change. This will still
require successfully passing the check and gate pipelines.
If the CI system is broken beyond all recognition and the jobs are failing even for the
change that is supposed to fix the system, the CI can be bypassed by placing
a `Verified+2` vote and manually submitting the change for merging. This can be done:
- via the Gerrit webui using an account with `Project-bootstrappers` membership
- via CLI, by logging in to the zuulv3.opencontrail.org and issuing Gerrit CLI commands.

Testing changes in contrail-zuul-jobs
-------------------------------------

The contrail-zuul-jobs repo contains roles and jobs for various projects, so
it is impractical to execute all the affected jobs in the check pipeline for
this repo. The only checks that are performed are unit tests and linting of
the Ansible code. If you're preparing a change that modifies a job for a
project you should test it as a dependent change:

#. create your change for the c-z-j project (change A).
#. create a dummy change (e.g. add an empty file) for the related project
   (change B). In the commit message for change B, specify change A as a
   dependent change using the "Depends-On:" directive.
#. place a comment under change A that contains a reference to change B, so
   that reviewers can verify that the changed job passed.
#. make sure that checks for the change B pass.

Transitional changes in CI
--------------------------

Because Zuul doesn't allow cycles in change dependencies (using the ``Depends-On:`` tags),
sometimes it is necessary to perform a transitional change in CI jobs. When one
wants to make a breaking change in one of the repos used in CI, he first
modifies the CI jobs to handle both versions of the repo (before and after
the breaking change), then merges the change in the repo, which now can pass CI
and then removes the support for the code before the change.
In case this is not possible, one can use the steps described in
"Emergency procedures" section.
